# React Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my React Portfolio project! This is an ongoing project where I am building a personal portfolio using React and Vite.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to showcase my skills and projects as a developer. The portfolio will include sections such as:

- About Me
- Projects
- Skills
- Contact Information

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Current Status
As this is a work in progress, the current setup includes:

- Basic React and Vite setup with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Initial ESLint configuration

## Future Plans
- Add components for different sections of the portfolio.
- Integrate a backend to manage contact form submissions.
- Improve styling and responsiveness using CSS frameworks or libraries.
- Deploy the portfolio to a hosting service.
